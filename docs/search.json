    "text": "2. Introduction\nLink to Proposal Presentation Link to Final Presentation Link to Final Paper\nThis analysis investigates the influence of climate change on international civil conflict. These interactions can occur through various mechanisms including poverty, scarce resources, migration, and other socioeconomic factors. Evidence suggests that poorer countries are disproportionately impacted. Climate change, through these mechanisms, fosters an environment that increases the risk of conflict. In terms of policy implications, the authors want to know if efforts in reducing climate change can reduce the risk of international civil conflicts. This analysis will focus on selected African countries consisting of South Sudan, Algeria, Cameroon, and Ethiopia. We begin by establishing our theoretical framework and by reviewing several key concepts. A brief literature review is conducted. We then expand on our data, methodology, and findings demonstrated by our visualizations.\nClimate change has been referred to as a “threat multiplier,” as it can overburden fragile states and exacerbate socioeconomic instability (Ruettinger et al. 2015). Firstly, climate change contributes to scarcity of resources, such as food and water. Scarcity can increase competition for these resources. In regions where resource management institutions are constrained, increased tension from scarcity can lead to conflict. According to A New Climate For Peace, “In much of Africa, which relies overwhelmingly on rain-fed agriculture, resource conflicts are more likely to break out over land, while in the irrigated fields of Central Asia, conflicts are more likely to arise over discrete water sources.” (Ruettinger et al. 2015; Unruh and Williams 2013). Building on this, customary land issues played a major role in over thirty intrastate conflicts in Africa between 1990 and 2009 (Pantuliano 2009). Moreover, this scarcity of land and agriculture increases the volatility of food prices. Food insecurity with overall increase in food prices can lead to civil unrest. For example, 14 countries in Africa experienced food riots in 2008, which had higher levels of poverty, less access to food, more urban areas, and more oppressive regimes than those countries that did not experience riots (Berazneva and Lee 2013)."

    "text": "3. Case Study: Ethiopia\nIn Ethiopia, extreme global weather events in 2008-2011 triggered an international “land grab” to secure farmland and food supplies via foreign direct investment. Approximately 46 million hectares were acquired in these land grabs, mostly in Sub Saharan Africa, with 1.2 million in Ethiopia. These land grabs lacked transparency and were often at the direct expense of surrounding local communities. The Ethiopian government engaged in forced relocation of communities which led to frequent violent conflicts. These relocations led local communities to believe that international actors were more important than local interests (Ruettinger et al. 2015). Moreover, in regions where people are dependent on natural resources, the constraining of these resources will also influence migration patterns. The reduction of arable land and water sources needed for irrigation or grazing land, will threaten livelihoods dependent on these resources and push large numbers of rural residents to urban areas that may not be equipped with infrastructure to handle large influx of individuals. A lack of viable alternatives can create conflict and unemployment. In Turkana, Kenya, many nomadic pastoralists have turned to fishing as pasture lands have dwindled due to recurring droughts, leading to deadly conflicts between rival Kenyan tribes with Ethiopian fishermen on the other side of the lake (Yongo et al. 2011). Climate change and extreme weather events also endanger assets and increase poverty. The economic costs associated with these disasters places additional stress on already strained government systems, especially in fragile areas with a history of conflict. For example, the 2011 East African drought intensified political instability by compounding grievances between groups over the poor governance of the food crises, leading to a full-scale humanitarian crisis and incidents of violence across East Africa (Harris et al. 2013).\nThe countries we are examining in this paper all ranked high in global fragility hotspots, defined as countries with high levels of instability, poverty, and climate change vulnerability–all of which compound the risk of conflict (Ruettinger et al. 2015). Fragility hotspots show how these socioeconomic elements can occur jointly and amplify each other. Repeated environmental disasters increasingly limit the ability of a government to adequately respond, eroding the credibility and legitimacy of government, which weakens the social contract between the government and the people."

    "section": "4. Case Study: South Sudan",
    "text": "4. Case Study: South Sudan\nSouth Sudan has endured four consecutive years of record breaking flooding. Two-thirds of the country is facing flooding. At least 60% of the 11 million people living in South Sudan have been impacted, and approximately 800,0000 livestock have died. There is an extreme need for adequate food, shelter, and water, and resources. Repeated disasters have muted the resilience and tools of the government disaster response system. Furthermore, many areas in South Sudan are difficult to access, cutting off many vulnerable communities from humanitarian aid. Over 2.3 million South Sudanese refugees have sought shelter in neighboring countries. South Sudan has faced civil war for most of its brief history. This humanitarian crisis has increased conflict risk and led to widespread intercommunal violence and conflict (Cheshirkov 2022).\nThrough a variety of data visualizations, this paper highlights the relationship between climate change and international civil conflict. The authors of this paper believe that addressing climate change can help reduce the risk of international conflict. Climate change can be viewed as a “threat multiplier” that amplifies socioeconomic instabilities that increase the likelihood of conflict. By mitigating climate change, the subsequent effects on these socioeconomic elements– including poverty, scarce resources, migration, and price volatility–can be dampened. The overarching implications of this paper show the interconnectedness of climate change and international conflict. While there is much debate in literature regarding the strength of the relationship between climate change and international conflict via the aforementioned socioeconomic vehicles, climate change mitigation efforts will still promote overall institutional resilience. Therefore policies addressing climate change should be incorporated into peace building efforts. The intent of peace building efforts through various institutions including the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the International Federation of the Red Cross, the G7+ initiative, and the G7 governments, is to build resilient societies thatcan absorb and address shocks while maintaining political and social stability. Such policies fall into three categories: (1) absorptive capacity defined as coping mechanisms during periods of shocks (2) adaptive capacity, or the ability of a system to adjust, modify, or change itself to mitigate future dangers (3) transformative capacity, or the ability to create a fundamentally new system that is not susceptible to climate change (IPCC 2014). In conjunction with humanitarian aid, an integrated approach to peace building should consider these three capacity elements within development and conflict prevention programs. Moreover, it is critical to recognize that the majority of emissions come from developed countries. Developing regions disproportionately feel the impact of climate change despite contributing less to overall emissions (Guterres 2022).\nThus, a concentrated and collaborative global effort is required in order to effectively reduce international conflict risk stemming from climate change."

    "text": "5. Literature review\nClimate change is the direct consequence of human activity. More than 99% of peer-reviewed articles assert that humans are the main cause of climate change (Ramanujan 2021). The increase in the Earth’s surface temperature is primarily due to the concentration of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere. This increase in the concentration of gasses is the result of burning fossil fuels and deforestation (Adams 2010). In addition, everyday human activities like driving cars, using air conditioners and electricity all contribute to the emissions of gasses in the atmosphere. The environmental effects of climate change include the rise in sea levels from melting glaciers. A study suggests that if only 8% of the Earth’s ice melts, much of the low-lying lands in the USA like Florida, New Orleans, Louisiana will be submerged under water. Low-lying countries like Bangladesh and the Netherlands are already seeing substantial increases in flood frequency (Thompson 2010). Among the countries that are most affected by climate change are generally less developed, more prone to social and political instabilities and are already facing some level of poverty. Most countries in Africa are vulnerable to climate change effects due to generally low adaptive capacity. Earthquakes, storms, floods and drought seemed to have contributed most to the percentage of economic damages as a share of GDP in the past decade for Africa (Ritchie, Rosado, and Roser 2022). These economic damages often lead to civil conflicts through events like political unrest and riots.\nA 2007 IPCC report gave a list of countries that are most vulnerable to the effects of climate change (IPCC 2007). Under climate conditions where extreme weather conditions are more prevalent, analysts believe that political conflict will be exacerbated due to dwindling resources and harsh environmental conditions. The regions that are highly sensitive to the effects of climate change according to this report are South Asia, the Middle East, and Sub-Saharan Africa. Since 1948, approximately two-thirds of all UN peacekeeping operations have been in these regions. Despite this, solutions for climate change are typically not included in peace building efforts (Matthew 2014).\nIn Africa, literature shows a strong historical linkage between civil war and temperature with warmer years leading to significant increases in the likelihood of war. When combined with climate model projections of future temperature trends, this historical response to temperature suggests a 54% increase in armed conflict incidence by 2030, or an additional 393,000 battle deaths. Moreover, this study found that in Africa, with 1 °C increase in the temperature, there was a 4.5% increase in civil war in the same year and a 0.9% increase in the conflict incidence in the following year (Burke 2009). The study underscored a strong relationship between temperature variables and conflict incidence. Since the end of the Cold War, there has been a decline in conflict (Gleditsch et al. 2002; Goldstein 2011). However, conflict casualties have risen over the past several years (Pettersson and Wallensteen 2015). Research indicates that worsening climate could increase conflict casualties, especially in susceptible regions. Civil conflict in particular produces more casualties than all other forms of conflict in a given year. Although climate change itself won’t cause civil conflict, the effects of climate change can make it more likely (Buhaug 2016).\nAn example of how the effects of climate change can be linked to civil conflict is the Syrian Civil War. The climate conditions in the region have led to historical conflicts over access to water. The UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization estimates that 60% of the renewable water in Syria comes from outside the country (Frenken 2009). Syria has also experienced rapid population growth over the last several years, which stretches already scarce resources (Gleick 2014). From 2006 to 2011, Syria experienced a significant drought that led to displacement and loss of resources (Worth 2010). The mass displacement and resource loss damaged the economy which led to social and political unrest. Some of the early bouts of unrest came from a large influx of displaced agricultural workers from regions where extreme droughts devastated their livelihood (Gleick 2014). The regime’s lack of resource management worsened these conditions, and the failure to address the negative economic and social effects of the drought was one of many factors that led to dissent (Saleeby 2012).\n\n\nCode\n# Visualization with area plots*** -------------------------------------------\n\n### ggplot geom_area\n# Go to Create de-aggregated data\n# Uncomment drop

    "text": "3. The future of Data Analysis - Edward Tufte\nWe are exposed to a an incredibly large amount of information by finding our way using applications like Google maps. I didn’t notice that there were 900+ words on the map! Our eyes can see a lot content and colors. Small changes like ghosting a player can make storytelling more efficient.\nGain a taste for excellent and thrive for it. Ask ourselves how things are done.\nHave an open mind but not an empty head: be ready to learn new things without giving up past knowledge.\nJohn W. Tukey: We assume that models can’t be useful because they oversimplify. However, ofter, they are. Do we even know what is useful anymore?\nMost public studies are false? We are trying to tell the truth. So why? Have we been overfitting our models? are the new tools to gather new data that is not accounted for? “If you torture the data long enough, it will tell you anything you want” is a powerful quote. It highlights the overfitting problem. Replication prices is more expensive. Then, how can we understand what has been done in the past and adjust it to future data?\nElectronic records did not improve mortality rate. What we really need is to use the new method to make necessary change, “to learn the truth” according to Tufte.\nConfirmatory Unhacked VS Exploratory Detective Work Tufte considered this, the future of data analysis with the example of FDA. It required better research designs because the data will have to be specified in advance.\nThe importance of Data Forensics = Give your data a health check. - People can’t keep their own score\nThe Thinking eye - Ask “How do you know?” - Are there any bias? - Look at the world and not it’s representation - What we see may not contain the answer"

Here, you can learn more about me and my Data Visualization journey.\nFor most of my college career, I was focused on completing both my undergraduate and graduate degrees in Economics. I knew that I like to code, but it wasn’t until the last semester on my graduate classes that I found a true passion for Data Visualization. I like to say that EPPS 6356 was my most challenging class, not because it was difficult, but because it enables me to be more creative and to learn how to code that creativity into meaningful charts.\nSince completing my degree, I left Data Visualization behind for a full time job that I loved. A year and a half later, here I am, feeling drawn back to it.\n\n\n\nYou can learn more about my schooling and career backgrounds in the About Me tab.\nThe Projects tab will give you a look into the some school projects I have worked on. I am very proud of the new way that I came up with to visualize natural disasters with their costs on a timeline in the EPPS 6356 Final Project. Hopefully, this page will have more new projects to that I will initiate on my own.\nThe Assignments tab was created as a part of the EPPS 6356 class. Since the assignments were not mandatory, I did not complete all of them by the end of the class. I hope to complete these assignments in the way that I had envisioned for this return to Data Visualization.\nThe Blog Posts tab is a place where I can share what I learned while completing an assignment or a project."

    "text": "III. Create a more customized and sleek look for my website\nI honestly spent most of the time working on the assignment on this part.\n\nA. Hiding things\nYou can check out the Quarto guide under the name of HTML Code Blocks.\n\n1. Hide huge code blocks with code folding\nAdd this in your title block.\nformat:\n  html:\n    code-fold: true\n\n\n2. Hide small or sections of code blocks by turning off echo\nJust add #| echo: false at the beginning of your R block.\n\n\n3. Hide warning messages\nJust add #| warning: false at the beginning of your R block.\nEvery time I run the codes with the tidyverse library, it keeps giving me this block of warning, which is what you would see in the console. So after hiding all the code blocks, I couldn’t hide this part of the output. It was upsetting.\n\n\n4. Hide/Collapse note or tips using Callout Blocks\nI will talk more about callout blocks in section E. since it is something that I learned as I was working on this first blog post.\n\n\n\nB. Insert media\nI just learned in the 9/13 lab that you can just click on the Insert Button using the Visual mode in R.I haven’t really explore this option yet.\n\nBelow, I have codes that you can copy to your code chunks.\n\n1. Images\nThis is just like using R markdown. I love pulling the images using a URL. This way, I don’t have to download it!\nInsert image from a local folder:\n![](image.jpg)\n![](image.PNG)\nInsert image using a URL:\n![](https://cpb-us-e2.wpmucdn.com/sandbox.utdallas.edu/dist/3/949/files/FL17-Logos.jpg)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen using a URL, you need to grab to correct link:\n\nRight click and select “Open image in new tab”\nThen, right click and select “Copy image address”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Embed Videos\nI used a package that I found online called vembedr. The package lets you use the URL for YouTube, Vimeo, Box and Microsoft Stream.\nHere is an example of what my code chunk for Assignment 1.\n#| warning: false\n#| label: fig-karen\n#| fig-cap: \"KarenXCheng uses Dall-E 2, an AI tool, to generate images. \"\n\nlibrary(\"vembedr\")\nembed_url(\"https://youtu.be/eUSx4_S6O34\")%&gt;%\n  use_align(\"center\")\n\n\n3. Hyperlinking URLs\n[Name your link](github.com)\n\n\n\nC. Live references and captions\nThis is called Cross References on the Quarto guide.\n\n1. In R blocks\n#| label: fig-lightgreen\n#| fig-cap: \"Light Green Color\"\n\n\n2. In text blocks\nTo my understanding this is a different type of markdown language.\n\n::: {#fig-sprawl}\n![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c77350965a707ed1710a1bc/1588698303774-0O4IBACSMA5J5ZB00ZOC/Sprawl+Generative+Art+by+Mark+J.+Stock.jpeg?format=1000w%22){width=\"60%\"}\n\nSprawl by Mark J. Stock &lt;- this is the caption!\n\n:::\n\n\n3. Refer to figure in text\n@fig-lightgreen is a modified version of \"Fall Color\"\n\n\n\nD. Theme of the website\nJust change the theme in the _quarto.yml file! Check out the different themes on the Quarto guide. It is called HTML theming.\nformat:\n  html:\n    theme: slate\n    css: styles.css\n    toc: true\n\n\nE. More website tools I learned about while creating this blog post.\n\n1. Add Copy Button\nAdd this block in your qmd file.\nformat:\n  html:\n    code-copy: true\n\n\n2. A Callout Box\nYou can check out the Callout Blocks in the Quarto guide. You can choose the type of callout box, and whether you want it to be collapsed by default.\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n\nWhatever you want to highlight here!\n\n:::\n\n\n3. Draft function\nBasically, you can render your website without publishing the new post.\nJust add draft: false to your title block."

Critique on a chart from published work\nThe Economic Consequences of Increasing Sleep Among the Urban Poor is an article that discussed an experimental research about sleep and its impact. Figure 7 sums up the findings of the study.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Summary of Treatment Effects\n\n\n\n\nColor:\n\nWhen I looked at Figure 7, I was immediately drawn to the larger colored area at the bottom of the graphic, separating the effects of a night-sleep treatment and nap treatment. Whatever is being tested, naps has a larger effect than night-sleep.\nThe next elements I saw were the tests grouped by colors since my eyes were already focused on the lower part of the graphics.\n\nFont:\n\nTo find out what the colors mean, I look at that top of the graphic. The categories of the tests are capitalized a bolted. At this point, I was able to compare the magnitude of the effects between night-sleep and naps. The graphic did a good job guiding my attention.\nThe title is in serif, whereas the rest of the graphic has sans serif font.\n\nAxis:\n\nThe vertical Axis has the size of the effect and horizontal axis has treatments grouped by categories in different colors.\n\nCanvas and Additional design:\n\nThe bar in the middle of the rectangles are standard deviations. This a clean and effective way to provide more information about the results.\nNext, I was curious about whether these effects were positive or negative. Here is where I don’t think the author did the best job. It was easier to see where the baseline (zero effect) was in the nap section thanks to the large rectangles for positive effects. However, it is harder to see whether the effects are positive or negative for night-sleep, especially when they are small like cognition effects. An easy way to rectify this is to add a grey or faint line at 0."
