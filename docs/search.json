    "text": "The guide on quarto.org is great tool to start this website. However, it took me some time to get familiarized with it. I started by running the codes for a lot of the examples. I was also doing Google searches of what I wanted to do with my website before realizing that most of the information I needed was in the guide! I will mention the guide page every now and then below.\n\n\nThe little button that on the top right corner of the code chunks serves as a great tool to copy and paste the code chunks. I didn’t understand why turning off echo or applying code folding didn’t work properly for me. Maybe, it was due to bad indentation, spacing… I spent a good hour trying to find different ways to do the same thing. Finally, the problems went away the moment I start using these buttons instead of highlighting the codes and copying them.\nTo see an example, expand the note below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nTo show the copy button for your own website, add this in your title block:\nformat:\n  html:\n    code-copy: true\nValid values for code-copy include:\n\n\n\nhover\nShow button on hover (default)\n\n\ntrue\nAlways show code copy button\n\n\nfalse\nNever show code copy button\n\n\n\nMy title block for this post looks like this!\n---\ntitle: \"Blog Post 1: Exploring Quarto and more\"\nsubtitle: \"What I learned while working on assignment 1\"\nauthor: \"Bel Khuu\"\ndate: \"2022-09-12\"\ncategories: [Code, R, Art, Assignment]\nimage: \"image.jpg\"\ndraft: true\nformat:\n  html:\n    code-fold: true\n    code-tools: true\n    code-copy: true\n---\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen I decided that I wanted a blog setup for this assignment tab, there wasn’t anything in the guide that talked about this. You either build a website or you build a blog.\nI figured that I should just create a temporary blog to see how it was different compared to a Quarto website. I found the files I needed and just copied them back my original project.\nThis is definitely an unusual way to do this. You can find the more straight forward way to do this under Listing Pages, under Documents Listings in the Quarto guide. Like I said, I explored around a lot before understanding that all I needed can be found in the guide. The note below is exactly what I did.\nYou can skip all the blog creation by downloading this Blog.zip file on my github page. Extract the files, then jump to the Merge the two project bullet point.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd a new folder on GitHub by creating a new file. I created a read me file in a new “Assignment” folder. I typed “newfoldername/readme.md”. This will create a new website branch. It will become a new directory for a Quarto project.\n\nbelkhuu.github.io will be referred to as website project\nbelkhuu.github.io/Assignments/ will be referred to as blog project\n\nStart a new project in R with the new directory and choose Quarto Blog.\nInspect the initial project folder, yaml and index files from the blog project folder\nMerge the two project:\n\nRename the index.qmd to assignments.qmd\nCopy the posts folder\nPaste both to my website project folder\nMake sure I added the Assignments tab is created in the website’s yaml file."

    "text": "III. Create a more customized and sleek look for my website\nI honestly spent most of the time working on the assignment on this part.\n\nA. Hiding things\nYou can check out the Quarto guide under the name of HTML Code Blocks.\n\n1. Hide huge code blocks with code folding\nAdd this in your title block.\nformat:\n  html:\n    code-fold: true\n\n\n2. Hide small or sections of code blocks by turning off echo\nJust add #| echo: false at the beginning of your R block.\n\n\n3. Hide warning messages\nJust add #| warning: false at the beginning of your R block.\nEvery time I run the codes with the tidyverse library, it keeps giving me this block of warning, which is what you would see in the console. So after hiding all the code blocks, I couldn’t hide this part of the output. It was upsetting.\n\n\n4. Hide/Collapse note or tips using Callout Blocks\nI will talk more about callout blocks in section E. since it is something that I learned as I was working on this first blog post.\n\n\n\nB. Insert media\nI just learned in the 9/13 lab that you can just click on the Insert Button using the Visual mode in R.I haven’t really explore this option yet.\n\nBelow, I have codes that you can copy to your code chunks.\n\n1. Images\nThis is just like using R markdown. I love pulling the images using a URL. This way, I don’t have to download it!\nInsert image from a local folder:\n![](image.jpg)\n![](image.PNG)\nInsert image using a URL:\n![](https://cpb-us-e2.wpmucdn.com/sandbox.utdallas.edu/dist/3/949/files/FL17-Logos.jpg)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen using a URL, you need to grab to correct link:\n\nRight click and select “Open image in new tab”\nThen, right click and select “Copy image address”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Embed Videos\nI used a package that I found online called vembedr. The package lets you use the URL for YouTube, Vimeo, Box and Microsoft Stream.\nHere is an example of what my code chunk for Assignment 1.\n#| warning: false\n#| label: fig-karen\n#| fig-cap: \"KarenXCheng uses Dall-E 2, an AI tool, to generate images. \"\n\nlibrary(\"vembedr\")\nembed_url(\"https://youtu.be/eUSx4_S6O34\")%>%\n  use_align(\"center\")\n\n\n3. Hyperlinking URLs\n[Name your link](github.com)\n\n\n\nC. Live references and captions\nThis is called Cross References on the Quarto guide.\n\n1. In R blocks\n#| label: fig-lightgreen\n#| fig-cap: \"Light Green Color\"\n\n\n2. In text blocks\nTo my understanding this is a different type of markdown language.\n\n::: {#fig-sprawl}\n![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c77350965a707ed1710a1bc/1588698303774-0O4IBACSMA5J5ZB00ZOC/Sprawl+Generative+Art+by+Mark+J.+Stock.jpeg?format=1000w%22){width=\"60%\"}\n\nSprawl by Mark J. Stock <- this is the caption!\n\n:::\n\n\n3. Refer to figure in text\n@fig-lightgreen is a modified version of \"Fall Color\"\n\n\n\nD. Theme of the website\nJust change the theme in the _quarto.yml file! Check out the different themes on the Quarto guide. It is called HTML theming.\nformat:\n  html:\n    theme: slate\n    css: styles.css\n    toc: true\n\n\nE. More website tools I learned about while creating this blog post.\n\n1. Add Copy Button\nAdd this block in your qmd file.\nformat:\n  html:\n    code-copy: true\n\n\n2. A Callout Box\nYou can check out the Callout Blocks in the Quarto guide. You can choose the type of callout box, and whether you want it to be collapsed by default.\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n\nWhatever you want to highlight here!\n\n:::\n\n\n3. Draft function\nBasically, you can render your website without publishing the new post.\nJust add draft: false to your title block."

One thing I want to change is to fix the text wrap so that when the code chunks are too long, you won’t have to use the cursor.\n\nWorking on Cloud storage\nIf you are like me and love to work on cloud storage, you will find this tip helpful. Please note that this might only with cloud storage apps that have a desktop drop folder.

    "text": "3. Critique on a chart from published work\nThe Economic Consequences of Increasing Sleep Among the Urban Poor is an article that discussed an experimental research about sleep and its impact. Figure 7 sums up the findings of the study.\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Summary of Treatment Effects\n\n\n\nColor:\n\nWhen I looked at Figure 7, I was immediately drawn to the larger colored area at the bottom of the graphic, separating the effects of a night-sleep treatment and nap treatment. Whatever is being tested, naps has a larger effect than night-sleep.\nThe next elements I saw were the tests grouped by colors since my eyes were already focused on the lower part of the graphics.\n\nFont:\n\nTo find out what the colors mean, I look at that top of the graphic. The categories of the tests are capitalized a bolted. At this point, I was able to compare the magnitude of the effects between night-sleep and naps. The graphic did a good job guiding my attention.\nThe title is in serif, whereas the rest of the graphic has sans serif font.\n\nAxis:\n\nThe vertical Axis has the size of the effect and horizontal axis has treatments grouped by categories in different colors.\n\nCanvas and Additional design:\n\nThe bar in the middle of the rectangles are standard deviations. This a clean and effective way to provide more information about the results.\nNext, I was curious about whether these effects were positive or negative. Here is where I don’t think the author did the best job. It was easier to see where the baseline (zero effect) was in the nap section thanks to the large rectangles for positive effects. However, it is harder to see whether the effects are positive or negative for night-sleep, especially when they are small like cognition effects. An easy way to rectify this is to add a grey or faint line at 0."

    "text": "3. The future of Data Analysis - Edward Tufte\nWe are exposed to a an incredibly large amount of information by finding our way using applications like Google maps. I didn’t notice that there were 900+ words on the map! Our eyes can see a lot content and colors. Small changes like ghosting a player can make storytelling more efficient.\nGain a taste for excellent and thrive for it. Ask ourselves how things are done.\nHave an open mind but not an empty head: be ready to learn new things without giving up past knowledge.\nJohn W. Tukey: We assume that models can’t be useful because they oversimplify. However, ofter, they are. Do we even know what is useful anymore?\nMost public studies are false? We are trying to tell the truth. So why? Have we been overfitting our models? are the new tools to gather new data that is not accounted for? “If you torture the data long enough, it will tell you anything you want” is a powerful quote. It highlights the overfitting problem. Replication prices is more expensive. Then, how can we understand what has been done in the past and adjust it to future data?\nElectronic records did not improve mortality rate. What we really need is to use the new method to make necessary change, “to learn the truth” according to Tufte.\nConfirmatory Unhacked VS Exploratory Detective Work Tufte considered this, the future of data analysis with the example of FDA. It required better research designs because the data will have to be specified in advance.\nThe importance of Data Forensics = Give your data a health check. - People can’t keep their own score\nThe Thinking eye - Ask “How do you know?” - Are there any bias? - Look at the world and not it’s representation - What we see may not contain the answer"
