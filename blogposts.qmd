I chose a blog setup for the assignments because it gives you a glimpse of what's being discussed on each post, and in chronological order. My latest assignments will be on the top!

My goal for this page is to create a blog post that includes what I have learnt for each assignment in this Data Visualization class. So, one assignment post and one blog post. They will be tagged "blog", "assignment", or "hackathon" under Categories.
